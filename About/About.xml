[b]The current version includes :[/b]
[list][b]The Harrow[/b], a faction of religious zealots that aim to purify the existence of all that is unholy within your colony. Starting with your very colonists&amp;apos; earthly vessels. To do so they use an assortment of goody-goods ! Thuribles, whips, flamethrowers and...candle holders ?[/list]
